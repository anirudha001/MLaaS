MLaaS
=====

This is our phase-I of Open Source Apache Hadoop Project for real time Big Data Analysis for various types of log data.This phase includes Machine Learning Recommendations using Apache Mahout.(Methodology used-Agile,using TDD).


#Below is the information of the contents of the Folders under this project:

1.AutoLog contains code to auto generate log files for testing.
2.LAASConstants,LAASCore and LAASRefLib are the prerequisites of Hadoop Family required to run the jobs in Hadoop Enviroment.
3.LAASPOC contains the main code written using Map-Reduce Progamming Model for log analysis.
4.Mlaas contains the Servlet-Jsp to communicate with the backend Hadoop environment from web application,hence making a
  real-time log anaysis.
